#Simon

###By: Mike Mahoney

Simon is a simple javascript app that mimics the game Simon Says.  I have chosen this app to be part of my portfolio  
because it demonstrates my understanding of javascript. Dovetailing my javascript knowledge with my problem solving  
skills allowed me to write the game in 36 lines of code.

##Installation

Install Simon app by cloning this repository:
```
